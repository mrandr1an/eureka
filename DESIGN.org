* Eureka Design Book
Mostly and idea book for me and what I want this project to be. Can help contributors aswell.
* Syntax
** Routines 
*Note every non-greek word in codeblocks is a template for what the user would write*
In Eureka there are 3 types of routines:
- Procedures
  Which take /N/ parameters and return nothing no matter what.
- Pure Functions
  Which take /N/ parameters with no side-effects and return a value.
- Methods
  Which take N parameters with side-effects and optionally return a value.
All three of the above contain a *BlockScope* type in which *variables* and *expressions* can be
used.
Example of a valid procedure:
#+begin_src eureka
  ΔΙΑΔΙΚΑΣΙΑ ΡΙΖΑ():
  ΕΚΤΥΠΩΣΕ 5.
#+end_src
A procedure name ΡΙΖΑ is the main entry for an executable program.
Example of a valid function:
#+begin_src eureka
  ΣΥΝΑΡΤΗΣΗ προσθεση(α: ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΙΚΟΣ, β: ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΙΚΟΣ) : ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΙΚΟΣ
  α + β. 
#+end_src
Example of an invalid function:
#+begin_src eureka 
  ΣΥΝΑΡΤΗΣΗ προσθεση(α: ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΙΚΟΣ, β: ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΙΚΟΣ) : ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΙΚΟΣ
  ΜΕΤΑΒΛΗΤΗ
  γ = α + β,
  ΕΚΤΥΠΩΣΕ γ,
  γ. 
#+end_src
The above is invalid because it uses a side-effect inducing procedure /ΕΚΤΥΠΩΣΕ/.
Example of a valid method.
#+begin_src eureka
  ΜΕΘΟΔΟΣ προσθεση(α: ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΙΚΟΣ, β: ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΙΚΟΣ) : ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΙΚΟΣ
  ΜΕΤΑΒΛΗΤΗ
  γ = α + β,
  ΕΚΤΥΠΩΣΕ γ,
  γ.
#+end_src
The idea is that a procedure should be responsible for the control flow and the state of the program itself simillar
to the "main" routine in other languages.
The standard library should contain procedures like /ΑΝ/ and /ΟΣΟ/ that use the /ς/ (goto) operator. Generally speaking the user should not
feel obligated to write their own procedures and are mainly meant for library usage.
Methods on the other hand are responsible for the application level details (what the programmer writes)
and unlike functions can communicate with "outside" sources like memory allocation, file handling and IO.
** Expressions
Expressions are used inside block scopes created by routines.
* Semantics
* Components
I want the compiler to be designed in a way that allows for future changes and improvements so
compartmentalization of component parts is key.Each component will have its own API and must be developed separately.
The idea so far is:
** Frontend
Contains everything related to language *syntax*, *semantics* and *types*. This includes the parser and the lexer.
*** Parsing and Lexing API
The language parser is supposed to have (at least in the future) two modes: Greek and English.
Both parse the same language but in their respective (human) languages. They cannot coexist in the same
codebase but can be translated from one to another.
See [[https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/patterns/behavioural/strategy.html][Stategy Pattern]] for the implementation, should be something like this:
#+begin_src rust
  enum AST
  {
   /*...*/
  }

  impl AST
  {
      fn generate<T: Parser>() -> Self
      {
	  todo!()
      }
  }

  trait Parser
  {
  
  }

  struct Greek;

  impl Parser for Greek{}

  struct English;

  impl Parser for English {}
#+end_src

The lexer produces a stream of tokens that are not aware of their context in the source code. As
a result many tokens are very abstract. For example the '.' operator which can be either the 'end of an
expression' or the 'access' operator of an aggregate type is just described as a 'Dot' variant of an enum Operator.
This is because we are certain that '.' is going to be an operator but not what until the parser decides according
to the context. 

The parser is responsible for sticking together the tokens it gets into an AST. At the time of writing this
I am not sure of what parser type is really needed for this language, probably a combination of an Earley and
Pratt algorithm.
*** AST
** Backend
Utilizes (and therefore depends on the AST API) to generate /N/ intermediate representations according
to a compilation specification (generated by a CLI or other tool).
** CLI
A frontend for the compiler itself. Should be relatively simple, at least for the start.
